## What is Diffusion?
- Random motion of particles
- Net movement from high â†’ low concentration
- Driven by thermal energy
- Examples: perfume in air, ink in water

## Fick's Laws (Intuition)
- Flux proportional to gradient
- Area and thickness matter
- Temperature affects rate
- Mathematical foundation

## Real-World Example
- Oxygen across alveolar membrane
- Implications for exercise physiology
- Medical applications
- Engineering design
