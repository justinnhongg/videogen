# What is Diffusion?
- Random motion of particles
- Net movement from high â†’ low concentration
- Driven by thermal energy

# Fick's Laws (Intuition)
- Flux proportional to gradient
- Area and thickness matter
- Temperature affects rate

# Real-World Example
- Oxygen across alveolar membrane
- Implications for exercise physiology
- Medical applications
